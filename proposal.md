## Software: *Firedrake*

Firedrake is described as "an automated system for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM)." Firedrake is similar to the FEniCS Project and makes use of their Unified Form Language as a means to specify a wide class of PDEs. This project is built off of PETSc and PyOP2. Firedrake has two layers in which "Layer 1: Firedrake" is the portable high-level finite element problem specification, and "Layer 2: PyOP2" is the parallel solver. The image belows shows this tool chain with the two layer abstraction (from [Firedrake: Re-imagining FEniCS by Composing Domain-specific Abstaction](https://fenicsproject.org/pub/presentations/fenics14-paris/FEniCS14FlorianRathgeber.pdf)).

### Notes/concerns/risks

I am unaware of any risks following this project. It appears that it should be straightforward making constributions to this project. The only risks I can foresee are associated with my own skills and my ability to make an appropriate contribute. I am excited for my attempt to be contribute to an open-source project like this!
